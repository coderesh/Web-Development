  <h1>Understanding Git and GitHub</h1>

  <p>Git and GitHub are both essential tools in the software development world, but they serve different purposes. Let's break down the key differences:</p>

  <h2>Git: Your Code Time Machine</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Git is a **version control system**. It tracks changes made to your code over time, allowing you to:</li>
      <li>Revert to older versions if needed.</li>
      <li>See who made what changes.</li>
      <li>Collaborate with others on projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Key features:</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Tracks changes:</strong> Stores snapshots of your code at different points in time.</li>
      <li><strong>Offline functionality:</strong> Work on projects even without internet.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Work with others easily, even in different locations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Think of Git as a time machine for your code, letting you travel back to different stages and see its evolution.</p>

  <h2>GitHub: Your Code Social Network</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>What it is:</strong> GitHub is a **web-based platform for hosting Git repositories**. It provides a user-friendly interface for working with Git, plus additional features:</li>
      <li><strong>Code storage:</strong> Store your Git repositories online, accessible from anywhere.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Share repositories and create pull requests to work with others.</li>
      <li><strong>Community:</strong> Access a vast developer community for resources and support.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Think of GitHub as a social network for code, where you can share your projects, collaborate with others, and learn from the community.</p>
